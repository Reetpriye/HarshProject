                Your smartphone or tablet is good for more than just posting cat
                videos on social media. Shocking, I know! But, consider this:
                Mobile devices are one of the most important developments in the
                history of learning technology. Period. Just think about it.
                Before the advent of mobile apps, if you wanted to learn
                anything for free there was only a handful of ways to go about
                it:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Learn what you want to learn in school
                </li>
                <li>
                  Check out a book from the library
                </li>
                <li>
                  Find someone willing to teach you for free
                </li>
                <li>
                  Find someone willing to pay for you to learn
                </li>
                <li>
                  Learn the hard way, through trial and error
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Of course, there was learning software long before cell phones
                were invented, but, like textbooks, you either had to buy it or
                check it out from your local library. Aren’t you lucky to be
                alive in the Information Age? Now, here are 15 of the best free
                mobile learning apps available on Android and iOS.
              </p>
              <h3>
                1. Udemy
              </h3>
              <p>
                Udemy is an online service that offers a vast array of courses
                on everything from web development to personal development. Want
                to learn how to play the guitar? Whether you’re a beginner or a
                virtuoso, Udemy’s got dozens of courses to help. How about
                starting your own business? Yeah, they’ve got that, too.
                Virtually any subject you can think of, chances are Udemy has a
                course for it taught by an industry expert.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Udemy app allows you to access all of your courses’ videos
                and learning materials on the go through your mobile device.
                Just keep in mind, while the Udemy app itself is free to
                download, you’ll have to pay for each course you take. Some
                courses are longer and therefore more expensive than others. The
                good news is Udemy frequently hosts blowout sales on many of
                their offerings, allowing you to buy a $100-plus course for as
                little as ten bucks!
              </p>
              <h3>
                2. Lynda
              </h3>
              <p>
                Similar to Udemy, Lynda.com boasts a huge variety of courses in
                a whole slew of different subject areas, such as video
                production or software development. The Lynda mobile app
                likewise gives you the freedom to learn at your own pace,
                whenever and wherever it’s most convenient for you.
              </p>
              <p>
                Unlike Udemy, however, Lynda’s vast library of courses is
                offered on a monthly subscription basis, allowing you to take as
                many courses as you like each month. Not sure if you want to
                commit to a monthly payment? You can take Lynda for a no-risk,
                ten-day test drive for free.
              </p>
              <h3>
                3. Khan Academy
              </h3>
              <p>
                <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a> is the
                non-profit brainchild of Sal Khan (no, not the Star Trek
                villain) and is one of the best learning apps available. Before
                founding the world-famous organization, Khan was a teacher,
                entrepreneur, and hedge fund analyst. In 2012, he was named by
                Time magazine as one of the 100 most influential people in the
                world.
              </p>
              <p>
                What’s different about the Khan Academy app when comparing it to
                services like Udemy or Lynda, however, is that all its courses
                are offered 100% for free. Like, literally. You can take as many
                of Khan Academy’s professionally taught courses at absolutely
                zero cost to you. Most of the organization’s classes focus on
                more “academic” subjects, such as math, science, and the
                humanities, though there are some great courses in computer
                science, too.
              </p>

                4. TED
              </h3>
              <p>
                Touting itself as a repository of “knowledge in dangerously
                addictive short ideas,” TED is another non-profit organization
                dedicated to the spread of intriguing or inspirational thoughts,
                usually in videos of 18 minutes or less. These videos, dubbed
                “TED Talks” can be on a diverse range of subjects, from art to
                science to global issues. The TED mobile app gathers the entire
                TED video library into one place for your education and
                enjoyment, and all content is free to view.

              <p>
                If you want to build muscle, you go to the gym and hit the
                weights. But, what do you do if you want to work out your brain?
                The <a href="http://www.lumosity.com/">Lumosity</a> app provides
                one solution by offering several series of brain-training
                “games” designed with the help of scientific experts and game
                developers. Lumosity’s brain exercises focus on improving your
                mental faculties, helping you learn new things, sharpen your
                focus, increase your retention, and solve problems faster and
                more efficiently. As with other apps mentioned in this list, the
                Lumosity mobile app is free to download to your device. But, to
                get the most out of the app, you might consider subscribing to
                Lumosity’s monthly service.

                6. Goodreads
              </h3>
              <p>
                Even in today’s digital world, books are still one of the best
                ways to learn about almost anything you can think of. There’s
                just one problem: There are a bazillion different books on a
                kajillion different subjects out there, and some of them are
                better than others. For instance, which books should you read if
                you want to gain skills in graphic design software such as Adobe
                Photoshop®, Illustrator®, or InDesign®? That’s where
                <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/">Goodreads</a> comes in.
              </p>
              <p>
                With over 40 million members, Goodreads is basically the
                Facebook of, well, books. Their mission is to get the right book
                in the right hands at the right time, whether it’s fiction,
                nonfiction, or self-help. No matter what your interests, the
                free Goodreads app can probably point you toward the perfect
                book to help you learn whatever it is you want to learn. You can
                read reviews from other readers, and share good reads of your
                own.

                Want apps that help you learn a foreign language? Whether you
                wish to learn Spanish, French, or one of 12 other available
                languages from around the world,
                <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/">Duolingo’s mobile app</a> is
                a great way to get started. The Duolingo app provides a
                user-friendly, go-at-your-own-pace system that works well for
                both beginning and advanced speakers. Using pictures and phrases
                spoken by native speakers, you’ll be beefing up your language
                skills faster than you can say, “Ich bin ein Berliner!”

                Lost in your classes? Need extra help cramming for your exam? A
                tutor can provide some assistance. But, if you’d like access to
                supplemental study materials created by students and teachers in
                courses similar to yours, check out the StudyBlue app.

              <h3>
                9. Wikipedia
              </h3>
              <p>
                There once was a time when people actually had multiple volumes
                of the encyclopedia on their bookshelves. Nowadays, we have
                <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a>. The
                Wikipedia app is a wellspring of knowledge on virtually every
                subject from academics to pop culture. Instead of lugging around
                multiple heavy volumes of the encyclopedia, you can now access
                millions of articles at your fingertips.
              </p>
              <p>
                Students be warned, however. Because anyone can edit articles in
                Wikipedia, most teachers do not consider it a reliable source of
                information for essays and other assignments. Instead of citing
                Wikipedia as the source, look up the original sources listed at
                the bottom of a specific Wikipedia article and then cite those
                in your research papers.
              </p>

                That’s right, folks! YouTube is more than just the only place in
                the world where you can watch a

              <p>
                Like Wikipedia, anyone can upload a video to YouTube, so be
                aware that some learning videos will be more reliable than
                others. How do you know whether a video on a certain subject is
                trustworthy? Look for one that’s made or has been posted by an
                expert with real-world experience in the subject you’re
                interested in.

                Users can also learn how to build websites, create apps, and
